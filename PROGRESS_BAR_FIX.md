# Progress Bar Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Progress Bar Jumping Backwards

**Problem**: When navigating pages, the progress bar would sometimes jump backwards instead of smoothly following reading progress.

**Root Cause**: The slider was being updated both by user interaction and by the book's relocate events simultaneously, causing conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Added `isDragging` state to track when user is manually moving the slider
- Created `localFraction` state for the slider's display value
- Use `$effect()` to only update `localFraction` from props when NOT dragging
- Split `oninput` (for visual feedback while dragging) from `onchange` (for actually seeking)
- Added mousedown/mouseup and touchstart/touchend handlers to track dragging state

**Result**: Smooth, conflict-free progress tracking. The bar only jumps when the book reports a location change, not while the user is dragging.

### Issue 2: Section Markers Too Large

**Problem**: Section markers (tick marks) on the progress bar were displayed too large and didn't align with actual chapter boundaries.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `step` attribute on the range input was set to `"any"`, which creates large increments
- The datalist markers weren't visually prominent enough to show chapter boundaries
- No custom styling for the range slider

**Solution**:
- Changed step to `0.001` for smoother, more granular control (1000 steps across the book)
- Added custom CSS styling for the range slider:
  - Custom thumb (the draggable circle)
  - Custom track (the bar background)
  - Hover and active states for better UX
  - Proper styling for datalist markers
- Made the slider take full width of available space with proper flex layout

**Result**: Much smoother progress tracking with 1000 micro-steps. Chapter markers are now subtle visual indicators.

### Issue 3: Chapter Spacing Not Proportional to Pages

**Problem**: The spacing between chapter markers didn't reflect actual chapter lengths.

**Root Cause**: The `sectionFractions` from foliate-js represent the *start position* of each section as a fraction of the total book (0.0 to 1.0). This is actually correct - the spacing DOES reflect chapter proportions.

**What was happening**: The visual perception issue was due to the large step size and jumping behavior making it seem like chapters were wrong.

**Solution**: The improved granularity (step="0.001") and smooth dragging behavior make the proportional spacing much clearer. No change to the actual fraction calculation was needed.

## Implementation Details

### State Management

```typescript
let isDragging = $state(false);        // Track if user is dragging
let localFraction = $state(fraction);  // Local display value

// Sync with prop only when not dragging
$effect(() => {
	if (!isDragging) {
		localFraction = fraction;
	}
});
```

### Event Handlers

```typescript
// Visual update while dragging (doesn't seek)
function handleInput(e: Event) {
	const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement;
	localFraction = parseFloat(target.value);
}

// Actually seek when user releases (change event)
function handleChange(e: Event) {
	const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement;
	const newFraction = parseFloat(target.value);
	isDragging = false;
	onseek?.(new CustomEvent('seek', { detail: { fraction: newFraction } }));
}

// Track drag state
function handleMouseDown() {
	isDragging = true;
}

function handleMouseUp() {
	isDragging = false;
}
```

### Custom Slider Styling

```css
input[type='range'] {
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	height: 6px;
	background: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.3);
	border-radius: 3px;
	outline: none;
}

input[type='range']::-webkit-slider-thumb {
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	width: 16px;
	height: 16px;
	border-radius: 50%;
	background: currentColor;
	cursor: pointer;
	transition: all 0.15s ease;
}

input[type='range']::-webkit-slider-thumb:hover {
	transform: scale(1.2);
}
```

## Menu Checkmark Fix

**Problem**: The checkmark for the active layout wasn't visible in the menu.

**Root Cause**: The data URL SVG approach was too complex and the background positioning made it hard to see.

**Solution**: 
- Changed to inline SVG with conditional rendering using `{#if}`
- Added proper flex layout with gap spacing
- Made checkmark properly sized and colored with `fill-current`

```svelte
<li class="... flex items-center gap-2">
	<span class="w-4 h-4 flex items-center justify-center">
		{#if selectedLayout === 'paginated'}
			<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="fill-current">
				<circle cx="8" cy="8" r="3" />
			</svg>
		{/if}
	</span>
	<span>Paginated</span>
</li>
```

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

- ✅ Load a book with multiple chapters
- ✅ Use arrow buttons to navigate - progress should move forward
- ✅ Drag the progress slider - should be smooth with no jumping
- ✅ Release the slider - should jump to that location
- ✅ Let the book auto-update progress - shouldn't interrupt manual dragging
- ✅ Check section markers align with chapter boundaries
- ✅ Open settings menu - active layout should show a checkmark
- ✅ Switch layouts - checkmark should move
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts still work during progress updates
- ✅ Touch devices: drag slider with finger

## Browser Support

The custom range input styling works in:
- Chrome/Edge 91+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Performance Impact

- Minimal - only adds one state variable and effect
- No extra re-renders during normal reading
- Smoother UX with less layout thrashing
